# Task 1: Compute tree density by neighborhood (I)

In order to compute tree density by neighborhood you need two things.
You will need to know the area of the neighborhoods, which you will
compute in the next exercise. And you need the tree counts by
neighborhood which is the focus of this exercise.

You will produce counts of all trees by neighborhood in NYC and create a
single data frame with a column for total trees. The result should be a
data frame with no geometry.

### Instructions

  - Load `sf`, `raster`, and `dplyr` in your workspace.
  - Load trees, neighborhoods, canopy, and manhattan objects from Week
    02 data folder
  - Use the `count()` function from `dplyr` on the trees object to
    compute total trees by neighborhood. The neighborhood variable is
    hood. Call the new object tree\_counts.
  - Use `head()` to take a quick look at tree\_counts and see if the
    geometry variable still exists.
  - Remove the geometry from your tree\_counts data frame.
  - The default for the `count()` function is to name the count field
    n. Use the `rename()` function from dplyr to change the column
    called n to tree\_cnt.
  - Use `hist()` to create a quick histogram of the tree counts.

Great, you’ve completed the first step toward computing tree densities.
You now have tree counts by neighborhoods and in the next exercise
you’ll compute the neighborhood areas.

# Task 2: Compute tree density by neighborhood (II)

We have the tree counts (from the previous exercise). In this exercise
you will compute neighborhood areas, add them to the neighborhood sf
object and then you’ll join in the non-spatial tree counts data frame
from the previous exercise.

### Instructions

  - Compute the areas of the neighborhoods with `st_area()` and wrap
    them in the `unclass()` function to remove the units. Save this
    object as areas.
  - Use `mutate()` to add the areas to your neighborhoods object. Call
    the new variable area.
  - `left_join()` the neighborhoods object (which should now have areas)
    and the tree\_counts object that you calculated in the last
    exercise.
  - Use `mutate()` with the given `ifelse()` code to replace NAs with 0.
  - Create a new column in neighborhoods called tree\_density which is
    tree\_cnt/area.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
# Compute areas and unclass
areas <- unclass(st_area(neighborhoods))

# Add the areas to the neighborhoods object
neighborhoods_area <- mutate(neighborhoods, area = areas)

# Join neighborhoods and counts by shared columns (find the matching one in neighborhoods)
neighborhoods_counts <- left_join(neighborhoods_area, 
                            tree_counts_renamed, by = c("ntacode" = "nta"))

# Replace NA values with 0 (lookup ifelse() function if needed)
neighborhoods_counts <- mutate(neighborhoods_counts, 
                            tree_cnt = ifelse(is.na(tree_cnt), 
                                              0, tree_cnt))

# Compute the density
neighborhoods_counts <- mutate(neighborhoods_counts, 
                               tree_density = tree_cnt/area)
```

You’re part way there. You have now computed the tree density variable
using, in part, the sf function st\_area(). In the next exercises you
will compute the average tree canopy values and then compare.

# Task 3: Compute average tree canopy by neighborhood

In the previous exercises you computed tree density by neighborhood
using tree counts. In this exercise you will compute average tree canopy
by neighborhood as a percentage so that we can compare if the results
are similar.

### Instructions

  - Use `head()` to confirm that your neighborhoods object has the
    density results from the previous exercises.
  - Transform the CRS of the neighborhoods object to match the canopy
    object (load the latter if needed).
  - Convert the neighborhoods object to an sp object for use with the
    raster package.
  - Compute the mean of canopy values by neighborhood using
    `raster::extract()` with the argument `fun = mean` (this might take
    a minute).
  - Use `mutate()` to add a new column avg\_canopy to neighborhoods,
    which is equal to canopy\_neighborhoods.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
# Confirm that you have the neighborhood density results
head(neighborhoods_counts)
```

``` r
# Transform the neighborhoods CRS to match the canopy layer
neighborhoods_crs <- st_transform(neighborhoods_counts, crs = crs(canopy, asText = TRUE))

# Convert neighborhoods object to a Spatial object (optional)
neighborhoods_sp <- as(neighborhoods_crs, "Spatial")

# Compute the mean of canopy values by neighborhood 
canopy_neighborhoods <- raster::extract(canopy, neighborhoods_sp, fun = mean)

# Add the mean canopy values to neighborhoods
neighborhoods_avg_canopy <- mutate(neighborhoods_crs, avg_canopy = canopy_neighborhoods)
```

Excellent\! Note that you transformed the neighborhoods object’s CRS.
This is actually not strictly necessary because `extract()` can
transform CRS on the fly. But it will be needed for plotting and other
operations later so doing manually is important here.

# Task 4: Create plots using `ggplot2`

As an initial review of the data you created you will compute
correlations and create histograms and a scatter plot using `ggplot2`.

### Instructions

  - Load the `ggplot2` package.
  - Create a histogram of total tree density using `ggplot()` with
    `geom_histogram()`. The object is neighborhoods\_avg\_canopy and the
    variable is tree\_density.
  - Create a histogram of average canopy (avg\_canopy) using `ggplot()`
    with `geom_histogram()`.
  - Create a scatter plot of tree\_density on the x-axis against
    avg\_canopy on the y-axis using `ggplot()` and `geom_point()`. Also
    add a smooth using `stat_smooth()`.
  - Compute the correlation between tree density and average canopy with
    `cor()` by running the given code.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
# Load the ggplot2 package
p_load(ggplot2)

# Create a histogram of tree density (tree_density)
ggplot(neighborhoods_avg_canopy, aes(x = tree_density)) + 
  geom_histogram(color = "white")
```

    ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.

``` r
# Create a histogram of average canopy (avg_canopy)
ggplot(neighborhoods_avg_canopy, aes(x = avg_canopy)) + 
  geom_histogram(color = "white")
```

    ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.

``` r
# Create a scatter plot of tree_density vs avg_canopy

    geom_point() +

```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula 'y ~ x'

``` r
# Compute the correlation between density and canopy
cor(neighborhoods_avg_canopy$tree_density, neighborhoods_avg_canopy$avg_canopy)
```

    ## [1,] -0.3414462

Nice\! `Ggplot2` is great for creating data graphics and in the next
exercise you’ll see that you can use `ggplot2` to make maps. In this
case the scatter plot and correlation suggest an unexpected result. If
anything, the street tree density data and tree canopy data are
negatively correlated. You will confirm this with maps in the next tasks
and you will learn why.

# Task 5: Create a map using `ggplot2`

The `geom_sf()` function operates like any other layer in `ggplot2`
where you can link variables to aesthetics on the plot through the
`aes()` function. In a mapping context this might mean, for example,
creating a choropleth map by color coding the polygons based on a
variable. If you leave off the aesthetic mapping `geom_sf()` will map
the geometry alone.

### Instructions

  - Ensure that `ggplot2` is loaded in your workspace and the CRS for
    both objects match (transform if needed. Note that there is no EPSG
    code, just a proj4string, for this CRS and this is fine.)
  - Use `ggplot()` and `geom_sf()` to create a map of tree\_density
    using the default colors.
  - Use `ggplot()` and `geom_sf()` to create a map of avg\_canopy using
    the default colors.
  - Alter the map of tree\_density by changing the colors with
    `scale_fill_gradient()`. The hex codes (a \# followed by numbers)
    for shades of green have been provided.
  - Alter the map of avg\_canopy by changing the colors with
    `scale_fill_gradient()`. The hex codes (a \# followed by numbers)
    for shades of green have been provided.

``` r
# Simplify name

Great\! You’re making progress in improving the graphics. The new layer
type `geom_sf()` is a big help for creating maps in `ggplot2`. Altering
the colors made the maps much more readable and you probably noticed
that they seem to show a different pattern. How about doing this with
`tmap`? See the next exercise.

# Task 6: Create a map using `tmap`

The `tmap` package is an excellent tool for making maps. You’ll see that
it simplifies the process of binning your data values for nice maps and
makes it easy to stitch together different layers.

tmap operates similarly to `ggplot2` in the sense that it starts with a
function, in this case `tm_shape()`, to set up the map and then is
followed by layers and other instructions separated with the +.

### Instructions

Load tmap library in your workspace. Use `tm_shape()` and
`tm_polygons()` to create a map of neighborhoods with no color-coding.
Use `tm_shape()` and `tm_polygons()` to create a map of neighborhoods
and color code by tree\_density. Create a new map by updating your
neighborhoods map to include `palette = "Greens"` in `tm_polygons()`.
Create a similar map of the variable avg\_canopy to include the
following arguments in `tm_polygons()`: `style = "quantile"` `n = 7`.

``` r
# Load tmap library
p_load(tmap)

# Create a simple map of neighborhoods
tm_shape(neighborhoods) + 
    tm_polygons()
```

![](Assignment-4_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
# Create a color-coded map of neighborhood tree density
tm_shape(neighborhoods) + 
    tm_polygons("tree_density")
```

![](Assignment-4_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-6-2.png)<!-- -->

``` r
# Style the tree density map
tm_shape(neighborhoods) + 
    tm_polygons("tree_density", palette = "Greens", 
        style = "quantile", n = 7, 
        title = "Trees per sq. KM")
```

![](Assignment-4_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-6-3.png)<!-- -->

``` r
# Create a similar map of average tree canopy
tm_shape(neighborhoods) + 
    tm_polygons("avg_canopy", palette = "Greens", 
        style = quantile, n = 7, 
        title = "Average tree canopy (%)")
```

![](Assignment-4_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-6-4.png)<!-- -->

You can see the beauty of `tmap.` It makes nice maps in R relatively
easily and provides a lot of flexibility to alter your plot as needed

# Task 7: Use tmap to create a final prettier(?) map

In this exercise you will use `tmap` to create a final map with three
map views to help you to compare the green you see in an aerial photo
with the tree density and average canopy results you computed by
neighborhood. The question you’re trying to answer is which measure,
tree density or average tree canopy, more closely matches what you can
see in the aerial photo.

Note: In map2, you will make use of the `bbox` argument to force the
view extents to match the aerial photo.

### Instructions 1/4

  - Remember to load `tmap`
  - Create and view a map of the manhattan aerial image with
    `tm_shape()` and `tm_raster()`.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
# Create a map of the manhattan aerial photo
manhattan_map <- tm_shape(manhattan) + 
  tm_rgb()
manhattan_map
```

![](Assignment-4_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)<!-- -->

  - Create and view a map of the neighboorhoods borders with
    `tm_shape()` and `tm_borders()`.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
# Create a map of the neighborhood polygons
neighborhoods_map <- tm_shape(neighborhoods) + 
  tm_borders(col = "black", lwd = 0.5, alpha = 0.5)
neighborhoods_map
```

![](Assignment-4_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)<!-- -->

  - Combine the manhattan and neighborhoods maps above with a + and save
    this as map1 (the neighborhoods layer/map should be second).
  - Create the second map of tree measures with `tm_shape()` and
    `tm_polygons()`. -Combine the two maps with `tmap_arrange()`, use
    `asp = NA` to map height/width to match the bounding box.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
map1 <- manhattan_map + neighborhoods_map #Fusion the two maps into a single map.


bbox_manhattan <- st_bbox(manhattan) # current bounding box


tree_measures_map <- tm_shape(neighborhoods, bbox = bbox_manhattan) + #Create a map with tree density
    tm_polygons("tree_density", palette = "Greens", 
        style = "quantile", n = 7, 
        title = "Trees per sq. KM")

avg_canopy_map <- tm_shape(neighborhoods,bbox = bbox_manhattan) + #Create a map with average canopy
    tm_polygons("avg_canopy", palette = "Greens", 
        style = quantile, n = 7, 
        title = "Average tree canopy (%)")

tmap_arrange(tree_measures_map, map1, avg_canopy_map, asp = NA)  #Plot the maps together
```

    ## Legend labels were too wide. The labels have been resized to 0.41, 0.41, 0.41, 0.41, 0.41, 0.41, 0.41. Increase legend.width (argument of tm_layout) to make the legend wider and therefore the labels larger.

Congratulations\! You’ve created a nice final map you can share with
colleagues to show how average tree canopy is a better representation of
green space than the tree density based on the Street Tree Census data
from NYC.
